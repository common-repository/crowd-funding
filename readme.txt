Works with PayPal's adaptive payments API to give you fully functional crowd funding right on your very own blog.

== Description ==

You know you have that dream project you want to start, if only you had the cash. Well, this plugin makes your project possible.

SiteOrigin's Crowd Funding uses PayPal to allow your visitors to commit to funding your project. You only charge them after you reach a target you set. It's an all or nothing funding system - much like Kickstarter.

Read more about it on [our official release post](http://siteorigin.com/wordpress-crowd-funding/).

This is an early release of Crowd Funding. It's fully functional, but not quite ready for the prestigious 1.0 tag. Please keep that in mind when using and rating this plugin.

To make up for it I'll be giving free tender loving support as I work towards 1.0 - just drop an email to support@siteorigin.com. After 1.0 I'll offer support through an open forum.

I'd love to hear about your projects - please email me and tell me about anything you have in the wild.
